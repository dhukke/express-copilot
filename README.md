# Express with copilot

The project was created to test github copilot extension.

In this project, an express server was created and all CRUD operations are persisted to a mongodb using mongoose.

# Mongo db

To run a mongodb container use the command (docker is required for this to work):

```
docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo
```
